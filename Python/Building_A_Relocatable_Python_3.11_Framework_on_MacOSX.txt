# *** IMPORTANT ***

# Build Prerequisite requirements for Python 3.11.3 on macOS 10.13 Sierra and later users:
#
#     First make sure you are using the latest XCode for your version of Mac OSX
#     Then make sure you have the command line tools (CLT) installed (via xcode-select --install)
#
#
#     For Python's pip3 and lzma module, and other Python functionality you will need to
#     compile and install the headers and static library versions of liblzma.a (xz),
#     libssl.a (libopenssl), and libcrypto.a (libopenssl), along side
#     static versions of sqlite, and a specially built internal TclTk library
#

# Create a build folder where all of the work will be done

# Now due to changes in Python3 since 3.9, the places it looks for the tcl8.6 and
# tk8.6 folders moves if Python3 is NOT installed in the standard framework
# location (not in /Library/Framework/Python.framework).
# So Python3 can not find its platform independent tcltk (tkinter) libraries
# on macOS if moved.   Because an "app" is needed for gui activity, these libraries
# must be found relative to the internal Python.app

# To allow our Python to fully moveable we must move these tcltk platform 
# independent files to a new lib folder placed in Python.app/Contents/
# so that they can always be found as follows:

cd ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/Resources/Python.app/Contents
mkdir lib
cd lib
mv ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/tcl8.6 ./
mv ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/tk8.6 ./

# and then use pip3 to install all other required python packages to its site-packages

export PATH=${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin:${PATH}
which pip3

pip3 install six
pip3 install html5lib

# Now a complete Python.framework has been built in ${MYDEST}
# But we still need to make it a relocatable framework

# To make it relocatable we need to use otool and install_name_tool to change
# the dylib name and path to it from all executables in the Python.framework

# A Quick Guide: On Mac OS X, one may use:
#     "otool -D <file>" to view the install name of a dylib
#     "otool -L <file>" to view the dependencies
#     "otool -l <file> | grep LC_RPATH -A2" to view the RPATHs
#     "install_name_tool -id ..." to change an install name
#     "install_name_tool -change ..." to change the dependencies
#     "install_name_tool -rpath ... -add_rpath ... -delete_rpath ..." to change RPATHs
 
# Make the framework's main dylib relocatable using rpath

cd ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/
chmod u+w Python
otool -D ./Python
install_name_tool -id @rpath/Python ./Python

# Change the dependencies of the executable files in bin to point to the relocatable 
# framework in a relative way and add the proper rpath to find the Python (renamed dylib)

cd bin
install_name_tool -change ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/Python @rpath/Python python3.11
install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path/../ ./python3.11


# so that python3 can find the Qt Frameworks and proper plugins for PyQt5

install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path/../../../../ ./python3.11

# now do the same for the Python.app stored inside the Python.framework Resources 
# This app is needed to allow gui use by python for plugins

install_name_tool -change ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/Python @rpath/Python ./Python
install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path/../../../../ ./Python

# And finally we need to change the name id on the libtk and libtcl to be rpath based
# and fix the _tkinter*.so to have an rpath with a @loader_path back up to the lib dir 
# where they live

cd ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib

# We should now have a fully relocatable Python.framework


# We will now use this just-built Python3.11 interpreter to install PyQt5, PyQtWebEngine and sip
# for Qt 5.15.X or PySide6 for Qt 6.X


# ***** IF USING QT5 ******

# **** Important: versions of PyQt5 and sip must be selected to match with the Qt version
# **** In these instructions we are using Qt 5.15.X and therefore need:
# **** sip-6.7.8 and PyQt5-5.15.9 and PyQtWebEngine-5.15.6 and PyQtS-sip

# First Build sip
# Building sip-6.7.8 from source and installing it into your Python Interpreter

# From https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5
# Download sip-6.7.8.tar.gz

# Must have the python interpreter you want to install PyQt5 into in the PATH to be found first

export PATH=${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin:${PATH}

# but first we need a few support modules

pip3 install packaging
pip3 install ply

# to build sip

# And Next build PyQtWebEngine (again with the destination python3 and qmake in your path)

# Download: PyQtWebEngine-5.15.6.tar.gz

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13

tar -zxvf ../sources/PyQtWebEngine-5.15.6.tar.gz

# And finally build PyQt5_sip and install it from source using PyQt5_sip-12.12.0
# Or use pip3 to install the latest PyQt5-sip
# pip3 install PyQt5-sip

tar -zxvf ../sources/PyQt5_sip-12.12.0.tar.gz
cd PyQt5_sip-12.12.0
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install

# And of course, the damn PyQt5_sip source build puts the pieces inside a
# damn egg and not where they truly belong inside site-packages/PyQt5.
# So fix it with the following:

cd ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages
cd PyQt5_sip-12.12.0-py3.11-macosx-10.13-x86_64.egg/PyQt5

# Your will need to have the packaging module installed on your python3

pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall packaging

# As well as a recent version of setuptools 
# (some newer versions have broken compatibility)
# pip3 install setuptools==59.8.0

# You will need libclang (although macOS has this lib pre-installed, it can *not* 
# be found by Qt's cmake.  Qt has pre-build binaries ready to be used for each platform.
# I recommend storing it someplace *outside* the normal path such as /opt to help 
# prevent future any name clash issues.
# Download  libclang-release_130-based-macos-universal.7z from:
#       https://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/

cd /opt
# and unpack libclang-release_130-based-macos-universal.7z in /opt to create /opt/libclang

# Tell the pyside6 build where to find it

export CLANG_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/libclang


# You should now be ready to build pyside6
