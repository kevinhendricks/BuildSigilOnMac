# Building_Qt6.5.2_From_Source_on_MacOSX

On Ventura you need XCode 14.3.1

# *** IMPORTANT ***
# We do highly recommend you use the same Qt versions as official Sigil builds on Mac OS X.
# which is now Qt 6.5.2 or later

# These instructions will lead you through building from source
# FIRST:  make sure you have XCode 14 or later installed and the Command Line Tools

# set the deployment target (this is minimum needed)

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0  # now set to 11.0 - but that is absurd in macx.conf

# cd to a location to store your src tree then do
export MYQTSRC=`pwd`


# Build Prerequisites
# -------------------

1. Make sure you have installed Python 3.11.3 or later and then use pip3 install html5lib as these
are needed by QtWebEngine

2. Make sure you have installed the ninja build tool into /usr/local (or use MacPorts).


# Next build and install the following prerequisites for the build: 
#      cmake, libpng, libjpeg-turbo 
# and install into /usr/local so that they can be found during qtwebkit's build
# Note: older versions of these prerequisites may work but have not been tested

# You should also download and install the ninja build tool

# Download cmake 3.26.4 or later from https://cmake.org/download
tar -zxvf sources/cmake-3.26.4.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.26.4
./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local -- -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
make -j4
sudo make install


# Download libpng 1.6.39 or later from png's sourceforge site: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-macosx_version_min,11.0"
export CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=11.0 -Werror=partial-availability"
tar -zxvf sources/libpng-1.6.39.tar.gz
cd libpng-1.6.39
./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no --prefix=/usr/local
make -j4
sudo make install
unset CFLAGS
unset LDFLAGS


# libjpeg-turbo 2.1.5.1 or later from libjpeg-turbo.org
# https://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/files/
tar -xvf libjpeg-turbo-2.1.5.1.tar.gz
mkdir buildjt
cd buildjt
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DENABLE_SHARED=0 -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE="-O3 -mmacosx-version-min=11.0 -Werror=partial-availability" ../libjpeg-turbo-2.1.5.1/
make -j4
sudo make install


# Building Qt6.5.2 from source
# -----------------------------
