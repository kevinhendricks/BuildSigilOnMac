# Building_Qt6_From_Source_on_MacOSX

On Big Sur you need XCode 13.2 (and nothing lower or higher)
The key is to use the latest XCode that runs on your build machine that includes
the macOS 12 SDK (or higher) and can target back to at least as far as macOS 10.14
(the farther back the better)

# *** IMPORTANT ***
# Qt Pre-Built Binary Versions do NOT support proprietary codecs such as 
# mpeg4 or gif multipmedia in its QWebEngine by default!

# To support these epub basic formats you will need to build your own Qt
# directly from source.

# We do highly recommend you use the same Qt versions as official Sigil builds on Mac OS X.
# which is now Qt 6.5.0 or later

# These instructions will lead you through building from source
# FIRST:  make sure you have XCode 12 or later installed and the Command Line Tools

# set the deployment target (this is minimum needed)

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15  # now set to 11.0 - but that is absurd in macx.conf

# cd to a location to store your src tree then do
export MYQTSRC=`pwd`


# Build Prerequisites
# -------------------

# You must have python3 installed with the html5lib module added in or QtWebEngine will not work

# First build and install the following prerequisites for the build: 
#      cmake, ninja, libpng, and libjpeg-turbo
# and install into /usr/local so that they can be found during qtwebkit's build
# Note: older versions of these prerequisites may work but have not been tested

# You must have python3 installed with the html5lib module added in or QtWebEngine will not work

# Download cmake 3.22.1 or later from https://cmake.org/download
tar -zxvf cmake-3.22.1.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.22.1
./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local -- -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
make
sudo make install


# Need to download and install latest ninja - from https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases
unzip ninja-mac.zip
sudo cp ninja /usr/local/bin
which ninja


# Download libpng 1.6.36 or later from png's sourceforge site: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
# If you are building on MacOS 10.15, you will need to patch libpng
# to support macos 10.15
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-macosx_version_min,10.15"
export CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.15 -Werror=partial-availability"
tar -zxvf libpng-1.6.36.tar.gz
cd libpng-1.6.36
patch -p0 < libpng_support_macos_10.15.patch
./configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
unset CFLAGS
unset LDFLAGS


# libjpeg-turbo 2.0.0 or later from libjpeg-turbo.org
# https://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/files/2.0.2/
tar -xvf libjpeg-turbo-2.0.2.tar.gz
mkdir buildjt
cd buildjt
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DENABLE_SHARED=0 -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15 \

# Building Qt6.5.0 from source
# -----------------------------

# For: PySide - https://download.qt.io/official_releases/QtForPython/


# download qt-everywhere-src-6.5.0.tar.xz directly from Qt
# from:  http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/

# and then unpack it
# Note to get unxz - you may need to download and build xz-5.2.5.tar.gz
# see the docs on building a relocatable python for instruction on building xz

unxz qt-everywhere-src-6.5.0.tar.xz
tar -xvf qt-everywhere-src-6.5.0.tar

# then apply an obvious fix for insertParagraph execcommand and h6 (see w3c spec)
# See https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-79778

# apply workaround to prevent missing macos application menu items

patch -p0 < ./qt650_fix_missing_macos_menubar.patch

# this is the new minimum supported by Qt
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15

# Create a destination directory to house your complete Qt binary in your home directory
# to be similar to how stock Qt does it

# Remember to include the -webengine-proprietary-codecs configure switch

../qt-everywhere-src-6.5.0/configure --prefix=/Users/${USER}/Qt650 -webengine-proprietary-codecs -- -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="10.15" 

# note the build itself can take a couple of hours depending on memory available, disk and cpus used
cmake --build . --parallel
cmake --install .

# Now apply the final patch to the post installed cmake file
cd /Users/${USER}/Qt650
patch -p0 < qt650_post_install_macos_ignore_bad_cups_cmake_find_failure.patch

# After the install phase completes your newly built Qt should exist in ~/Qt650 ready to be used
# to build Sigil and PageEdit


****IMPORTANT****
Need to fix python_pkg for Qt6 on macos to "add" not replace the following rpaths to each of the *.abi3.so modules:

Note this does not happen in current version and no rpaths exist in those abi.so so you need to handle that case.

@loader_path/../../../../../../..

#     "install_name_tool -rpath ... -add_rpath ... -delete_rpath ..." to change RPATHs
